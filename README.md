# DECODER2TO4
# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis Decoder using Xilinx ISE.

# Apparatus Required:
Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

# PROCEDURE:
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the FloorplanArea/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

# Program
```
module decoder_8(a,b,c,y);
input a,b,c;
output [7:0]y;
and gl (y[0], (~a), (~b), (~c));
and g2 (y[1], (~a), (~b), (c));
and g3 (y[2], (~a), (b), (~c));
and g4 (y[3], (~a), (b), (c));
and g5(y[4], (a), (~b), (~c));
and g6(y[5], (a), (~b), (c));
and g7(y[6], (a), (b), (~c));
and g8 (y[7], (a), (b), (c));
endmodule
```
# Output
![313528719-5b9c1cbb-49f2-4087-9acc-80f034edfce3](https://github.com/RESMIRNAIR/DECODER2TO4/assets/160302888/ecda35e2-ba01-4116-9a40-2b77284852be)
# Result
Hence Decoder Verified.
